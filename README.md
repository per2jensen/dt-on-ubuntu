# Compile darktable on Ubuntu
This is a collection of scripts for compiling different versions of DarkTable 
on different versions of Ubuntu. The versions follows what I am using on my 
workstation :-)

There are 2 ways to install Darktable:
  1. Darktable releases can be installed in a VM for trying it out.

        It is easy to build on your local machine, but trying out in a VM first is nice.
  
  2. Follow Git Master on your computer using the script for that.


# Dependencies
* KVM 

    kvm must be installed in order for multipass to work
    Take a look here: https://www.tecmint.com/install-kvm-on-ubuntu/

* Multipass
    
    The scripts require Ubuntu Multipass to be installed, as all activity
    takes place within a virtual machine. You can of course create your own 
    Ubuntu VM and fire off the "compile script" there.

    Multipass is a snap away on Ubuntu: 
        snap install --classic multipass

* DT clone location

    DT is cloned to this location within the VM: /home/ubuntu/git/darktable

* Installation
    Darktable is installed into /opt/darktable within the VM.
      


# What the scripts do:
The compile script does the following:

*    creates/starts a VM called ubuntu<version>-DTcompile
*    clones Darktable from Github into the VM
*    adds llvm repoes to the VM's APT sources
*    adds llvm APT key into the VM
*    installs loads of necessary Ubuntu packages in the VM
*    builds and install Darktable in the VM
*    starts Darktable to print the --version info in the VM

The end result from running "darktable --version" on the latest supported build, is:
````

# How to compile Darktable 5.0.0 for Ubuntu 24.04 in a VM

````
    git clone https://github.com/per2jensen/dt-on-ubuntu.git
    cd dt-on-ubuntu/24.04/DT50
    chmod u+x install_in_vm.sh
    ./install_in_vm.sh
````

If you have an old VM lying around and want to start from a fresh, do this:

````
    multipass stop   ubuntu2404-DTcompile
    multipass delete ubuntu2404-DTcompile
    multipass purge 
````

## Shell access to VM to see the buildlog

````
# become the 'ubuntu' user in the VM
multipass shell ubuntu2404-DTcompile  

# view the output captued from 'configure' and 'make'
less DT-5.0.0.log
````

## Output from 'configure'

The full log file has been saved in git ("[DT-5.0.0.log](https://github.com/per2jensen/dt-on-ubuntu/blob/master/24.04/DT50/doc/DT-5.0.0.log)", for viewing if you are interested


# Build on your machine

Once you are happy that things work in the VM, consider changing
a couple of env vars:

- set the DT_SRC_FOLDER env variable in 24-04/DT50/DTcompile.sh
- set the INSTALL_PREFIX env var in 24-04-DT50/envvars

and run the DTcompile.sh to enjoy the DT goodness :-)

# How to follow Git Master, to be on the bleeding edge

    git clone https://github.com/per2jensen/dt-on-ubuntu.git
    cd dt-on-ubuntu/24.04/DT48
    chmod u+x master_compile.sh
    ./master_compile.sh

Edit the environment variables to your taste.
